# Engima2_to_m3u_and_xmltv

Enigma2 to M3u and XMLTV allows you to generate m3u and xmltv files for use in iptv players such as Tivimate and plex,
it should work with all software that accepts these inputs

allowing you to get your terrestrial tv to your other devices.....
for example i am using it to get all the terrestrial channels to my androidtv nvidia shield

## Setup
1) Download/clone script 
2) edit stb_epg.cfg with your settings
3) Make the script is ready to run by: chmod +x stb_epg.sh
4) Run the script with help parameter first time: ./stb_epg.sh -HELP if you need help for parametes.
5) First time the script is used you need to run ./stb_epg.sh -GET_ALL 
to get data from your STB

This forces the creation of channel list from bouquets.

every time you change your bouquets you need to run GET_ALL, otherwise it will only update the epg
